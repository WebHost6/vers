This repo is a clusterfuck of files that I host. It was previously used for my Iframe unblocker but that is now end of life and will no longer be worked on.
Here is the stuff this repo is being used for now:
- Archives of byte, my iframe unblocker
- Html files for eagler craft
- Download instructions for neostellar
- File hosting for services like neostellar
- The files from when I attempted to port sudo to iframe

If your here looking for an unblocker, please see neo.md, though its also important that I mention if you are not part of my school district, you will be unable to use it. This is a personal project im maintaining for me and my friends, and should not be used outside of that.
