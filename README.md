# Byte hub 3.1.4

the offical github repository for byte hub. the current version is 3.1.4

> everything you need, all in one place

from what i can tell, the tech department switched from a block list to a allow list, meaning every website is blocked other then the websites they specify. this is great for me
becasue the unblocking websites people were using have been all hit by this block wave. this means more traffic for be, unfortinatly my website got hit too. but github is not
unblocked, so this the offical github repository.

## instructions for install

1. click on byte3.1.4.html

2. in the top right corner next to raw there should be a download button, click said button

3. the download should start, once its finished click "show in files"

4. open the file it downloaded by clicking it twice

5. (optinal but recommended) bookmake the page it brings you to.

## usage

click on the "unblocker" tab and enter the website url into the input, if you want the url of a blocked website but when you try to click on the website and copy the link it gets blocked then
you can right click on it and select "copy link address"

> [!WARNING]
> this is not a search engine, you cant type whatever you want into here it has to be a url, also not all urls work, see the following section for the reason



## Todo

- [x] update system
  - broken due to website blockage, will be fixed soon
- [ ] save settings
