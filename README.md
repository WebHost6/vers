# Byte hub 3.1.4

the offical github repository for byte hub. the current version is 3.1.4

> everything you need, all in one place

from what i can tell, the tech department switched from a block list to a allow list, meaning every website is blocked other then the websites they specify. this is great for me
becasue the unblocking websites people were using have been all hit by this block wave. this means more traffic for me, unfortinatly my website got hit too. but github is
unblocked, so this the offical github repository and will stand in place of a domain for now.
despite the website getting blocked i will keep it up for backwards compatibility for kids who dont have it blocked in their schools

> [!NOTE]
> if there is a feature you would like to add or a bug you would like me to fix, dont hesitate to create an issue

## instructions for install

1. click on byte3.1.4.html

2. in the top right corner next to raw there should be a download button, click said button

3. the download should start, once its finished click "show in files"

4. open the file it downloaded by clicking it twice

5. (optinal but recommended) bookmake the page it brings you to.

## usage

click on the "unblocker" tab and enter the website url into the input, if you want the url of a blocked website but when you try to click on the website and copy the link it gets blocked then
you can right click on it and select "copy link address"

> [!WARNING]
> this is not a search engine, you cant type whatever you want into here it has to be a url, also not all urls work, see the following section for the reason

## why not all websites work
if a website works is not up to me, its up to the creator or orginization behind the website. most large websites like google, youtube, discord, etc do not allow embeding and will
give the message "______ refused to connect" this is because people could create a malicious webpage that pretends to be a diffrent website and when they ask you to log in it steals
your password, so this was done to prevent that. im sure there are other reasons but thats the one im aware of.

## Todo

- [x] update system
  - broken due to website blockage, will be fixed soon
- [ ] save settings
