# How to download and run Neostellar

~1. click [here](https://github.com/WebHost6/vers/raw/refs/heads/main/launcher.zip) to download the zip file~
~2. move the zip file to your downloads, pin it if you like~
~3. unzip the file, then click 'OpenMe.html' two times quickly to open it~
~4. when you open it for the first time, it will ask you to allow popups, once you do you can refresh~
~5. click 'open'~

this process has changed, Ill update these instructions hopefully before the school year begins
